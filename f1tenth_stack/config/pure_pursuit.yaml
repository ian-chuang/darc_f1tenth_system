    # Lookahead is computed using the following: lookahead = min(max(min_lookahead, max_lookahead * curr_velocity / lookahead_ratio), max_lookahead);
    min_lookahead: 0.5
    max_lookahead: 5.0 # lookahead when the car is going around max velocity
    lookahead_ratio: 8.0 # approximately the max velocity
    K_p: 0.2
    steering_limit: 35.0
    velocity_percentage: 0.8 # the limit, can only do 1 lap with clean tires
